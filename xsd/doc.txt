In root element, there are appended both "Workflows" and "Processes".
A process is linked to a workflow by the Workflow name (it is unique).

In workflow there can be more actions and, for each one, there can be:
- following actions, if parent is a simple action;
- a nested workflow, represented by the name, if parent is a process action.

In process there can be more actions (in here they are called "actionStatus") and each one contains the actor who take care about that.
